Print Your Own Headset
=========================

Find the files on `Github <https://github.com/mindaffect/Headset>`_, and a quick tutorial on `YouTube <https://youtu.be/Aez5LA2C2G4>`_ of V1.0 made by Nikolai Schauer. Please read the printing guide before trying to print.

Parts
-----

Per headset, 3 pieces need to be printed:

- 1x Main-Part.stl 
- 2x Attachment.stl  


We recommend semi-flexible filament, but anything flexible should work.
Stiff material like PLA, PETG or ABS won’t work!
We used “Renkforce Flexible Filament” for all prototypes.

Print settings
--------------

We recommend these print settings:

- Nozzle: 0.4 mm
- Extrusionwidth: 0.5mm
- Layerheight: 0.25mm Brim: 3mm
- Speed: 20mm/s
- Infill: 40% (This value can be adjusted to compensate for more flexible filament; a higher infill
  value will make for a more stiff headset)
- Perimeters: 5
- Bottom layers: 5
- Top layers: 5
- Temperature: See filament spool


The print settings are of course dependent on your personal printer and will most likely require
some tuning.
The parts were designed to fit on most buildplates, in some cases “Main-Part.stl” needs to be
rotated by a few degrees (Prusa MK3 for example).
