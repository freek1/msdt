`Unity <https://unity.org>`_ is a popular cross-platform video game development environment.  In this video tutorial we show how you can easily add brain-controlled objects to your existing game using our unity `API <https://github.com/mindaffect/unitymindaffectBCI>`_

**Note: this video is orginally for the `mindaffect Kickstarter Kit <https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/bci/make-100-create-your-own-brain-computer-interface>`_  so includes some references to the kit or fake-recogniser which are not relevant for the open-source release.  All the unity specific parts remain unchanged.  Just start the fake-recogniser with

.. code::

   python3 -m mindaffectBCI.online_bci --config_file fake_recogniser
